    <h3>Urbanization Trends & Visual Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      These charts visualize key trends such as the evolution of urbanization over time, gender-based population shifts, and the relationship
      between road density and urban expansion. These insights support policy planning, zoning adjustments, and infrastructure optimization.
